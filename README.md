# GUCON-star

Here, we present a comprehensive framework called GUCON (Generic Graph Pattern based Policy Framework for Usage Control)-Star that focuses on specifying and enforcing usage control policies in various domains. The GUCON framework leverages the power of graph patterns to provide flexible and adaptable policy specification and enforcement mechanisms. By representing policies as graph patterns, we enable the expression of complex relationships and dependencies between different elements of the system. This approach will allow a fine-grained control over the usage of resources, ensuring compliance with specific requirements and restrictions.

# Use Case 

An embargo on extracts from a football match usually refers to a restriction placed on media outlets or individuals regarding the publication or dissemination of certain content from the match until a specific time or event has passed. This could include highlights, photographs, interviews, or other media materials. Embargoes are often imposed to ensure fair coverage, prevent spoilers for delayed broadcasts, or control the timing of information releases for strategic reasons.
